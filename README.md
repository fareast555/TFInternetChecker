# TFInternetChecker
Checks if connected Internet, and distinguishes between no connection, and a 100% package loss scenario. Free to use and share with no restriction. If you use it in an app, Iâ€™d love to see it at work, so please let me know! 

HOW TO USE (Objective-C: Swift to follow in a few months)

Drag TFInternetNSURLCheckSingleton.h / .m into your project folder and then into xCode.

Import the singleton within the class that will be checking for Internet connectivity

The singleton is called with a completion block that returns a typeDef. The method takes one argument, which is the amount of time you want the singleton to keep checking before it times out: 

[[TFInternetNSURLCheckSingleton sharedInternetNSURLCheck] checkConnectionStatusWithTimeout:11.0f AndCompletion: ^(TFInternetStatus status) { 

  //Code to check which connection status typedef is returned 
   }];

The singleton uses the same logic as other Internet checker solutions: It tries to download a data file from the Internet. But TFInternetNSURLCheckSingleton is different in that it also prevents system freezes in situations of 100% packet loss (when the user's device is connected to a router, but the router is not connected to the Internet).  

TFInternetNSURLCheckSingleton returns one of 3 typedefs: 
     TFInternetStatusNoInternet, 
     TFInternetStatusFullyConnected, 
     TFInternetStatus100percentLoss

Check for these in the completion block as indicated above.

if (status == TFInternetStatusFullyConnected) { You're connected. Do something!} 

if (status == TFInternetStatusNoInternet) { The user has no connection. Alert! } 

if (status == TFInternetStatus100percentLoss) { The user may see a connection, but they are not actually reaching the Internet }

Install the Network Link Conditioner developer tool to simulate 100% package loss to test everything out. 

Hope you find it useful!
